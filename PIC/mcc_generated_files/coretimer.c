  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CORETIMER driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CORETIMER.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - pic24-dspic-pic32mm : v1.45
        Device            :  PIC32MM0064GPL036
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC32 1.43
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.61
